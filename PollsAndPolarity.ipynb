K-Nearest Neighbors performed slightly worse and the Decision Tree classifier performed worst of all. However, as I added final comments to this file, I realized that I had not fine-tuned all of the parameters for the neural network. I do not recall the source of the original parameters, which is an ethical misstep. As such, I updated the parameters. This increased the efficacy of the Neural Network and now it matches the average accuracy of the Linear SVC classifier. Naive Bayes is still the third most accurate, on average.\n",

After the update, the Neural Network is equally successful. Previously, the KNN classifier was fourth, but it has swapped places with Naive Bayes. I do not believe that adjusting the Neural Network parameters should have affected the KNN classifier, so I am unsure what caused this shift. I cleared the kernel before I re-ran all cells, so this is not a vestigial result. Still in last place is the Decision Tree classifier.\n",

The Linear SVC is now fourth. Prior to the paramater tuning of the Neural Network, the Naive Bayes classifier, Linear SVC, and Neural Network classifier were followed by the KNN classifier, then the Decision Tree classifier.

Since Sanders' input/target is the most consistent, it's not surprising that these were the most successful predictions. This was true on average and shown even more strongly with these specific predictions. "

    "I do not believe that the predictions herein can be considered fully reliable, but there are some slight correlations shown. These correlations can be compared to those uncovered by the Tableau viz, found [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/emma.highland#!/vizhome/MSDS692/Pollcomparison). I found that less of a correlation is shown in the Tableau viz than shown here. The visualized time series only shows a pattern (an inverse correlation) with Warren, where the Twitter sentiments become less positive over time, while her poll order rises. Sanders has stagnated in his poll ordering, as shown here as well with the consistency of his 3rd place prediction. His sentiment scores have become slightly more positive over time, but I would have expected the positive sentiment to correlate with rising poll order. This did not occur. Biden goes through patches of more positive and more negative sentiments, but this does not correlate positively or negatively with the changes in his poll order. He has only vacillated between 1st and 2nd, rather than the range and rise shown by Warren.\n",
